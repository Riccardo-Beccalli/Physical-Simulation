# Physical-Simulation
In this folder there are many  C++ programs about physical simulations.




In many of this programmes I use Gnuplot for drawing graphs, if you don't have gnuplot you can always install it.
For installing Gnuplot you just have to open the terminal and type "sudo apt-get install gnuplot-x11".
If you need help for use it you can always whatch the online documentation at this link http://gnuplot.info/docs_5.2/Gnuplot_5.2.pdf
